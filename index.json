Jackson Faculty Scholar at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science (affiliated). She is part of Computer Architecture @ UW-Madison and Machine Learning @ UW-Madison. She is one of the PIs in SRC JUMP center – Center for Research on Intelligent Storage and Processing-In-Memory (CRISP). She spent her early career at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center as a Research Staff Member after obtaining her PhD degree from Purdue University in 2009.\nShe is attracted to all the big problems she can find in computer system across the stack regardless the specific sub-areas. She is a passionate computer experimentalist and enjoy building real computer systems (both hardware and software). She has made contributions to the following “memory-centric” areas: 1) domain-specific accelerator and its interaction with emerging memories (HMC/HBM/NVM), 2) programmable in-memory computing architecture enabled by emerging nonvolatile memories (PCM/RRAM), 3) system support (e.g., virtualization) for accelerators (e.g., FPGA), and 4) FPGA-based full system simulation infrastructure (MEG) for memory system research. She has strong ties with leading technology companies and has successful technology transfer experience (\u0026gt;40 issued/pending patents).\nShe is the recipient of prestigious NSF Career Award in 2018, DARPA’s Young Faculty Award (one out of 2 in computer area and one out of 26 across all areas in science and technology nationwide, the first awardee in computer engineering and computer science at UW-Madison) in 2016, WARF Innovation Awards (WIA) Finalist (only 6 patented technologies out of 400+ patents got selected university wide), IBM Research Division Outstanding Technical Achievement Award in 2012 for successfully achieving CEO milestone , multiple invention achievement awards and high value patent application awards from IBM from 2010-2014, IBM Ph.D. Fellowship Award in 2008, Meissner Fellowship in 2004 from Purdue University, etc. Her research was reported by Yahoo News, Newegg Business, Digital Trends, etc. And she was featured in Madison Magazine (Channel 3000) as a rising research star.\nShe has been serving on the technical committee for the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA), SysML,International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM), Design Automation Conference (DAC), International Conference on Computer‑Aided Design (ICCAD), International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED), International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) (external), IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), etc.. She served as the advisory chair/general chair / technical chair / finance chair / publicity chair for a premier industry memory conference – International Memory Workshop (IMW) and co-organized it with Intel/Micron/SK Hynix/CEA LETI to hold annual meetings with worldwide memory vendors. She is in the Steering/Organizing Committee for IMW, and serves as the Publicity Chair for FPGA’19 and ISLPED’18, the Demo Chair for SysML’20 . She is an editor for Journal of Low Power Electronics (JOLPE). She is serving at ACM SIGDA Technical Committee on FPGAs and Reconfigurable Computing (TC-FPGA).\n","date":1565323061,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1565323061,"objectID":"63412de3bfd3c7aa1f169e816da53be8","permalink":"https://bdai6.github.io/authors/jing-li/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/jing-li/","section":"authors","summary":"Dr. Jing Li is an assistant professor and Dugald C.

We present the physics behind this large resistivity contrast and describe how it is being exploited to create high density PCM. We address the challenges facing this technology, including the design of PCM cells, fabrication, device variability, thermal cross-talk and write disturb. We discuss the scalability, assess the performance, and examine the reliability of PCM including data retention, multi-bit storage and endurance.","tags":["journal"],"title":"Phase change memory
