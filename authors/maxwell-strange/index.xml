      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maxwell Strange was an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing degrees in both Computer Engineering and Computer Science. At WiCIL, his current research interests included workload acceleration through software/hardware co-optimization as well as signals applications. He was the president of the IEEE student organization on campus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maxwell is now a PhD student at Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;
