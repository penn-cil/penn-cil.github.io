      <title>Research Overview</title>
      <link>https://penn-cil.github.io/research/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At PennCIL, our research focuses on future systems in two general directions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augmenting computer systems with domain specific accelerators and emerging memories&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; an essential step towards next-generation systems. It requires modest system changes and has low deployment barrier but the performance gain might be potentially limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Architecture/Algorithm Co-design&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large scale graph analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning and AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechanisms and Abstractions for Virtualization in Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Source Computer System Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking computer systems with post-CMOS technology&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; a more aggressive approach in pushing innovations across the entire system stack. It could lead to dramatic improvement in performance but often requires more disruptive change in both hardware and software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquid Silicon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two-Dimensional Associative Processor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Full paper Submission Deadline:       September 9, 2019&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt; Artifact Submission Deadline: September 9, 2019\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA 2020) is the premier conference for presentation of advances in FPGA technology.  Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and available in the ACM Digital Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-submissions-sought&#34;&gt;Types of Submissions Sought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-research-papers-with-and-without-artifacts&#34;&gt;1. Research Papers (with and without Artifacts)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we solicit research papers related to the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA Architecture: Architectures for programmable logic fabrics or their components, including routing, flexible logic cells, embedded blocks (memory, DSP, processors), and I/O interfaces. Novel commercial architectures and architectural features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA Circuit Design: Circuits and layout techniques for the design of FPGAs. Impact of future process and design technologies on FPGAs as well as novel memory memory or nano-scale devices. Methods for analyzing and improving static and dynamic power, power and clock distribution, yield, manufacturability, security, reliability, and testability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAD for FPGAs: Algorithms for synthesis, technology mapping, logic and timing optimization, clustering, placement, and routing of FPGAs. Novel design software for system-level partitioning, debug, and verification. Algorithms for modeling, analysis and optimization of timing and power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-Level Abstractions and Tools for FPGAs: General-purpose and domain-specific languages, tools, and techniques to facilitate the design, debugging and verification of FPGA-based applications and systems. Novel hardware/software co-design and high-level synthesis methodologies enabling digital signal processing, compute acceleration, networking, machine learning, and embedded systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA-based and FPGA-like Computing Engines: Systems and software for compiled accelerators, reconfigurable/adaptive computing, and rapid-prototyping.  Programmable overlay architectures implemented using FPGAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications and Design Studies: Implementation of novel designs on FPGAs establishing state-of-the-art in high-performance, low-power, security, or high-reliability.  Designs leveraging unique capabilities of FPGA architectures or demonstrating significant improvements over alternative programmable technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU). Design studies or architecture explorations enabling improvement of FPGA architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research submissions may be either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full: at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a full presentation at the conference; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short: at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper submitted as either full or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-tutorial-papers-on-emerging-applications--methodologies&#34;&gt;2. Tutorial Papers on Emerging Applications / Methodologies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference will include a Sunday workshop oriented toward users of FPGAs: be it deep learning implementations, computer security or other emerging topics of interest. For this category, we solicit tutorial papers describing effective design techniques and design flows. The ideal submission will enable beginning researchers to enter the area, current researchers to broaden their scope, and practitioners to gain new insights and applicable skills.  Tutorial submissions need not present novel research results, but should integrate expert practical and/or research knowledge related to FPGAs for a broader audience. This may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical descriptions of new commercial or academic design tools of general interest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insightful summaries of the state-of-the-art that suggest open research problems; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-depth design tutorials and design experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorial submissions are &lt;em&gt;at least 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;at most 10&lt;/em&gt; pages. Accepted submissions are published in the proceedings and allocated a presentation time of up to one hour, appropriate to the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-panel-discussion-proposals&#34;&gt;3. Panel Discussion Proposals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also solicit proposals for the panel discussion at the conference banquet. The submission should outline the topic, questions to be addressed, and suggested speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;submission-process---please-read-carefully&#34;&gt;Submission Process - please read carefully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file, on-line at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.softconf.com/j/fpga2020/&#34;&gt;https://www.softconf.com/j/fpga2020/&lt;/a&gt;. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/&#34;&gt;http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/&lt;/a&gt;. LaTeX users should use the format used in the &lt;code&gt;sample-sigconf.pdf&lt;/code&gt; file under the &lt;code&gt;Samples&lt;/code&gt; folder of the zipped master file (downloadable through the &lt;code&gt;LATEX (Version 1.61)&lt;/code&gt; link). Microsoft Word users can download the file &lt;code&gt;Interim layout.docx&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;Word Authors&lt;/code&gt; section of the page. Abstract and Full Paper Submissions must be received by &lt;strong&gt;September 9, 2019 at 11:59 PM AoE&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe&#34;&gt;Anywhere-on-Earth time zone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions will be considered for acceptance as full or short regular papers, workshop papers, or posters. Regular submissions related to the workshop topic may be scheduled for presentation during the workshop. Regular or workshop submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. A paper submitted to the short or full paper category will only be considered in that category. Once a paper has been submitted, its authorship list is considered to be fixed and finalized. As the inclusion and evaluation of artifacts is new for FPGA 2020, additional information will be provided at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isfpga.org/artifactEvaluation.html&#34;&gt;http://www.isfpga.org/artifactEvaluation.html&lt;/a&gt; by August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;double-blind-policy&#34;&gt;Double Blind Policy:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. &lt;strong&gt;Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered&lt;/strong&gt;. References to the authors’ prior work should be made in the 3rd person, in the same way one would reference work by others. If necessary to maintain anonymity, citations may be shown as &amp;ldquo;Removed for blind review,&amp;rdquo; but consider that this may impede a thorough review if the removed citation is crucial to understanding the submission. When necessary, authors should cite widely-available Open Source software website(s) without claiming ownership. Grant numbers and other government markings should also be blinded during the review process. Placing a preliminary version of the unpublished paper on arXiv is not disqualifying, but it is also not encouraged. Similarly, if a paper can be unblinded by active search, this is not considered to undermine the spirit of the double-blind review. However, there are resources to blind open-source repositories for review, including: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github.&#34;&gt;https://github.com/tdurieux/anonymous_github.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;If you have questions about how to meet these guidelines, please contact the program chair before the submission deadline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reviewer-conflict-policy&#34;&gt;Reviewer Conflict Policy:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be registered with all possible program committee members. Conflicts are defined as all relationships that would prevent a reviewer from objectively evaluating the submitted work.  This includes, but is not limited to, having within the past 5 years: 1) co-authored a publication, 2) shared a funding award, and 3) shared at least one institutional affiliation. &lt;strong&gt;Note: if a conflict is declared (or left undeclared) in an attempt to manipulate the review process, the submission may be rejected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the situation where the potential conflict is with the program chair, please contact the program chair well before the submission deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;originality-of-submissions&#34;&gt;Originality of Submissions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers submitted for FPGA 2020 are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have an archived proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rebuttal-process&#34;&gt;Rebuttal Process:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPGA 2020 includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response of up to 500-words to reviewers’ questions and comments. This information is considered during the final deliberation process.  The Rebuttal phase will begin by &lt;em&gt;October 14th&lt;/em&gt; and end &lt;em&gt;October 18th&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;author-participation&#34;&gt;Author participation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to attend the conference to present the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;best-paper-award-and-a-special-acm-trets-issue-for-best-of-fpga-2020&#34;&gt;Best Paper Award and a Special ACM TRETS issue for Best of FPGA 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors of this year’s best manuscripts will be eligible for the conference&amp;rsquo;s best paper awards. They will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM&amp;rsquo;s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS) for FPGA 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-artifact-evaluation&#34;&gt;NEW: Artifact Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPGA 2020 will allow authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated the final publication.  The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without.  Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes.  Artifact evaluation must NOT interfere with the double blind reviewing process of their accompanying papers, so &lt;strong&gt;all accompanying links in the paper to the artifacts should be blinded&lt;/strong&gt;. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will be also be associated artifacts for evaluation.  If artifacts will be included, a descriptor of their nature will be required as part of the submission. For more information, go to: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isfpga.org/artifactEvaluation.html&#34;&gt;http://www.isfpga.org/artifactEvaluation.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guidelines on Artifact Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://penn-cil.github.io/artifact-evaluation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://penn-cil.github.io/artifact-evaluation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have questions, you can email: &lt;a href=&#34;artifactevaluationchair@isfpga.org&#34;&gt;artifactevaluationchair@isfpga.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this initiative is to promote reproducibility of published results by highlighting papers supported with open-source code. These papers are identified by badges promoted by ACM.  More details are provided below.&lt;br&gt;
We are asking all authors to indicate whether or not there are artifacts associated with their paper(s).  Artifacts are not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artifact-form-requirements&#34;&gt;Artifact Form Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-artifact-form&#34;&gt;What is the Artifact Form?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Artifact Form  is  part of the information  you must fill out when you submit  your paper to FPGA 2020.  The form describes the presence or absence of computational artifacts (software, hardware or data) that supports the research presented in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-the-artifact-form-required-in-order-to-submit-to-fpga-2020&#34;&gt;Is the Artifact Form required in order to submit to FPGA 2020?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an author, you must answer the question whether or not you have artifacts when you submit your paper.  If you have artifacts then please complete the remaining questions. Note that you do not need to have artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-need-to-make-my-software-open-source-in-order-to-complete-the-artifact-form&#34;&gt;Do I need to make my software open source in order to complete the Artifact Form?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. You are not asked to make any changes to your computing environment or design process  in order to complete the form. The form is meant to describe the computing environment in which you produced your results and any artifacts you wish to share.  Any author-created software does not need to be open source, unless you wish to be eligible for an ACM Artifacts badge (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-process&#34;&gt;Review Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-will-review-my-artifact-form&#34;&gt;Who will review my artifact form?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviewers of your paper will not have access to the Artifact form.  If your submitted paper is accepted to FPGA 2020, then the Artifact form will be reviewed.  The  Artifact Evaluation  Committee (AEC) will review the appendices, and will check that artifacts are indeed available at the URLs provided. They will also help authors improve their forms, in a double-open arrangement.  If authors select this option (by answering yes to question 12), their paper may be evaluated for the Artifacts Available &amp;ndash; Reusable or Artifacts Available Functional badges.    Some papers will be evaluated for the ACM “Results Replicated” badge.  If your paper is chosen, then the artifact evaluation committee will be in contact with the authors if they have questions regarding your artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-will-review-of-appendices-interact-with-the-double-blind-review-process&#34;&gt;How will review of appendices interact with the double-blind review process?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifact review will not take place until after decisions on papers have been made.  Reviewers will not have access to the artifact form.  Authors should not include links to their repositories in their paper.  The paper review process is double blind.  The artifact review process is not.  .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact-of-artifact-form-af&#34;&gt;Impact of Artifact Form (AF)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-the-impact-of-an-artifact-form-on-scientific-reproducibility&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of an Artifact Form on scientific reproducibility?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility depends on, as a first step, sharing the provenance of results with transparency, and the AF  is an instrument of documentation and transparency.  A good AF helps researchers document their results, and helps other researchers build from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many good reasons for formalizing the artifact description and evaluation process. Standard practice varies across disciplines. Labeling the evaluation as such improves our ability to review the paper and improves reader confidence in the veracity of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artifacts&#34;&gt;Artifacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-author-created-artifacts-and-why-make-the-distinction&#34;&gt;What are &amp;ldquo;author-created&amp;rdquo; artifacts and why make the distinction?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author created artifacts are the hardware, software, or data created by the paper&amp;rsquo;s authors. Only these artifacts need be made available to facilitate reproducibility. Proprietary, closed source artifacts (e.g. commercial software and CPUs) will necessarily be part of many research studies. These proprietary artifacts should be described to the best of the author&amp;rsquo;s ability but do not need to be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-proprietary-author-created-artifacts&#34;&gt;What about proprietary author-created artifacts?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal case for reproducibility is to have all author-created artifacts publically available with a stable identifier. Papers involving proprietary, closed source author-created artifacts should indicate the availability of the artifacts and describe them as much as possible. Note that results dependent on closed source artifacts are not reproducible and are therefore ineligible for most of the ACM&amp;rsquo;s artifact review badges. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging&#34;&gt;https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-the-numbers-used-to-draw-our-charts-a-data-artifact&#34;&gt;Are the numbers used to draw our charts a data artifact?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Data artifacts are the data (input or output) required to reproduce the results, not necessarily the results themselves. For example, if your paper presents a system that generates charts from datasets then providing an input dataset would facilitate reproducibility. However, if the paper merely uses charts to elucidate results then the input data to whatever tool you used to draw those charts isn&amp;rsquo;t required to reproduce the paper&amp;rsquo;s results. The tool which drew the chart isn&amp;rsquo;t part of the study, so the input data to that tool is not a data artifact of this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;help-my-data-is-huge-how-do-i-make-it-publically-available-with-a-stable-identifier&#34;&gt;Help! My data is HUGE! How do I make it publically available with a stable identifier?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Zenodo (&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.zenodo.org/&#34;&gt;https://help.zenodo.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Contact them for information on how to upload extremely large datasets. You can easily upload datasets of 50GB or less, have multiple datasets, and there is no size limit on communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-the-impact-of-an-artifact-form-on-scientific-reproducibility-1&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of an Artifact Form on scientific reproducibility?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artifact-evaluation effort can increase the trustworthiness of computational results. It can be particularly effective in the case of results obtained using specialized computing platforms, not available to other researchers. Leadership computing platforms, novel testbeds, and experimental computing environments are of keen interest to the FPGA community. Access to these systems is typically limited, however. Thus, most reviewers cannot independently check results, and the authors themselves may be unable to recompute their own results in the future, given the impact of irreversible changes in the environment (compilers, libraries, components, etc.). The various forms of Artifact Evaluation improve confidence that computational results from these special platforms are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;acm-artifacts-available-and-artifacts-evaluated-badges&#34;&gt;ACM Artifacts Available and Artifacts Evaluated Badges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging&#34;&gt;https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The badges we will consider for FPGA2020 are &lt;em&gt;Artifacts Available, Artifacts Evaluated — Functional, Artifacts Evaluated — Reusable and Results Validated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging&#34;&gt;ACM Badging definitions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts Available badge: This badge is applied to papers in which associated artifacts have been made permanently available for retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Artifact form (new for FPGA 2020) will be used to determine eligibility for an ACM Artifacts Available badge on the basis of the answers to questions about the availability of author-created software, hardware or data products. The conditions of eligibility are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All author-created software artifacts are maintained in a public repository under an OSI- approved license.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All author-created hardware artifacts are available and comply with the Open Source Hardware Definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All author-created data artifacts are maintained in a public repository with a stable identifier, such as a DOI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts Evaluated — Functional badge: The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts Evaluated — Reusable badge: The artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated – Functional level, but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results Replicated badge: The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exact replication or reproduction of results is not required, or even expected. Instead, the results must be in agreement to within a tolerance deemed acceptable for experiments of the given type. In particular, differences in the results should not change the main claims made in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how research articles that develop algorithms or software systems could be labeled as described above. Here, the artifacts could be implementations of algorithms or complete software systems, and replication would involve exercise of software, typically software provided by the author. However, we intend these badges to be applicable to other types of research as well. For example, artifacts associated with human-subject studies of novel human-computer interface modalities might be the collected data, as well as the scripts developed to analyze the data. &amp;ldquo;Replication&amp;rdquo; might focus on a careful inspection of the experimental protocol along with independent analysis of the collected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes-about-artifacts&#34;&gt;Notes about artifacts:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A design artifact can be a hardware or software design. Software could include design tools or host code.  Hardware designs can include designs intended to become ASICs, or designs that map to FPGA fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware artifacts should comply with the Open Source Hardware Definition.  See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oshwa.org/definition/&#34;&gt;https://www.oshwa.org/definition/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
